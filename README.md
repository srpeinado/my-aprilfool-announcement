# Extinction Rebellion NYC's April Fools 2020 Action
This is the collaborative repo for XR NYC's April Fools Announcement against Google.


## Key Goals
* Education: Google is funding climate change denial [(orignal articles)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/google-contributions-climate-change-deniers).
* Google Denies: Google is forced to deny, thus affirming that they're still doing this bad thing.

## Things To Build
We are going to replicate this [Google company's announcement](https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help/), with the central message of "Google stops funding climate change deniers".
